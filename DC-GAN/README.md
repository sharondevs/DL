## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network(GANs)

GANs are the state-of-the-art CNNs for generating images through neural network processing. I used the powerfull pytorch APIs for implementing the model. The dataset is provided in the data folder.
The peculiarity of GANs is that it is a hybrid of CNN and DeCNN networks.The DeCNN being the Generative block and the CNN being the Adversarial block. 
Applications :
-Generating Images
-Image Resolution
-Super Resolution
-Assisting Artists
-Speech Gneration
-Photo-Realistic Images
