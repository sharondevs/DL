## Face Detection using opencv
This is a simple alogrithm for face detection using opencv. The detection is done by using haar function-based 
feature classifier by cascading the features of the face and the eyes.
The haar-based cascade xml file is attached in the repo.
For getting the xml files for the haar cascade,for different case face detection like smiling and even for detecting the body, we can
get the xml files from the github repo :
